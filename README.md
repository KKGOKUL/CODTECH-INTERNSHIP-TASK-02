# Password Strength Checker Project

## Objective

  ### The objective of this project is to assess the strength of a given password by analyzing its complexity, length, and resistance to common weaknesses. This tool provides feedback on improving password security, aiming to educate users on best practices for creating strong, secure passwords.

## Key Features

### Password Length Check: Evaluates whether the password meets a minimum length requirement of 8 characters and encourages using more than 11 characters for added security.

### Character Variety Checks: Verifies the inclusion of different character types:

  ### Uppercase letters
  
  ### Lowercase letters
  
  ### Numbers
  
  ### Special characters (e.g., @, #, $, %)
  
  ### Common Password Detection: Compares the input password against a list of common passwords, discouraging the use of easily guessable options like “123456” or “password.”
  
  ### Pattern Detection: Identifies simple, predictable patterns, such as sequences (“1234,” “abcd”) or repeated characters, that reduce password security.
  
  ### Password Strength Scoring: Provides a strength rating (Weak, Moderate, Strong) based on cumulative checks and assigns a score for better user understanding.
  
  ### Detailed Feedback: Offers specific recommendations to improve the password, such as adding different character types or avoiding common patterns.

## Usage

  ### The tool is implemented as a Python function, check_password_strength(password), which takes a password as input and outputs a strength assessment along with improvement suggestions.

### Step 1: The user inputs a password.

### Step 2: The function evaluates the password based on predefined security checks.

### Step 3: A strength rating is assigned, and feedback is provided to guide users in enhancing their password.

## Example Output

### For a password input:

### Strength: "Weak," "Moderate," or "Strong"

### Feedback: Suggestions to improve the password, like "Add uppercase letters" or "Avoid simple patterns."

### Potential Enhancements

### Integrate the tool into a web or desktop application for broader accessibility.

### Expand the common passwords list using a more extensive dataset.

### Add additional checks, such as detecting dictionary words, to further enhance password assessment accuracy.
